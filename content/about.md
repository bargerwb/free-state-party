title: About — Free State Party
description: Not a nonprofit. Not a political party. A private club for liberty-minded free staters in New Hampshire.

## The Driver of the Bus is Dead.

Periodically, civilizations go through major reformations.

The Bronze Age. The age of Mediterranean empires. The Christianization of the Roman Empire. The Collapse that led to the High Middle Ages. The Enlightenment and the birth of the Westphalian Nation State system.

A crisis arises, and the old solutions don't work, and new solutions and forms must be found.

We have perfected democracy. The law, in its infinite majesty, allows everyone to vote. Elon Musk gets one vote, just like Crazy Willie who lives under the bridge with three shopping carts.

The system has been made fully legible, and it has been fully exploited. The political coalitions and egregores work their magic, through the media, through the NGOs, through the universities, through the DoW, through the voters themselves.

**So that's it, then? Take the black pill, because everything is over, the game is lost?**

## We Take the Wheel.

What we build will not look precisely like anything that came before. There is no going back. We will never RETVRN.

We can learn from the past, but we must create something new.

Not a nonprofit. Not a political party — despite the name. Not a friendship club.

We are the rewrite. We correct the mistakes.

We are men who build businesses, raise healthy families, win elections, and shape the culture.

If you burn to secure the blessings of liberty for us and our posterity and have the brain to do it, join us.
