# Come Meet Us

## We'd like to get to know you.

This isn't an application. There's no form to fill out, no committee to review your resume. We just want to know who you are.

Tell us a bit about yourself — what brought you to New Hampshire, what you're building, what you believe. We'll reach out and set up a time to meet in person.

**We're selective, but not serious about it.** We just want to know you're one of us.

form_intro: Drop your info below and we'll be in touch.
