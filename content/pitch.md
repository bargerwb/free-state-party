# The Pitch

## You didn't move here to attend committee meetings.

Every 500 years or so civilization goes through a major reformation. A crisis arises, and the old solutions don’t work, and new solutions and forms must be found. The Bronze Age. The Bronze Age Collapse. The age of Mediterranean empires. The Christianization of the Roman Empire. The Collapse of the Roman Empire. The High Middle Ages. The Enlightenment and the birth of the Westphalian Nation State system. And now, here, at the “end of history”, we find that history has not actually ended. Once again, the old system contained within its fundamental thesis the seeds of its own destruction.

In 2024, we have perfected democracy. The law, in its infinite majesty, allows everyone to vote. Elon Musk gets one vote, just like Crazy Willie who lives under the bridge with three shopping carts. A professor of mechanical engineering gets one vote, just like a Cool Wine Aunt who watches The View every day. The system has been made fully legible, and it has been fully exploited. The political coalitions and egregores work their magic, through the media, through the NGOs, through the universities, through the DoD…through the voters themselves.
