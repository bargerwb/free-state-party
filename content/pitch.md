# The Pitch

## You didn't move here to attend committee meetings.

Test deploy.

You uprooted your life because you believe something. You left behind a career, a neighborhood, maybe a whole social circle — because New Hampshire was supposed to be different.

And it is. But the organizations are stale. The meetings are lifeless. The same twelve people run everything, and the energy that pulled you here is buried under bylaws and Robert's Rules of Order.

**You came here to build something. So did we.**

The Free State Party is what happens when people who actually believe in something find each other. Not an org. Not a movement. A room full of people who get it — and who are doing something about it.
