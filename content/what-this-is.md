# What This Is

## This is not an organization.

Not a nonprofit. Not a political party — despite the name. Not a Telegram group. Not a Zoom call.

**The Free State Party is a private club.** In person. By invitation. We meet, we talk, we eat, we build. The people in this room are building businesses, raising families, winning elections, and reshaping the culture of an entire state.

We don't recruit. We invite. And we don't apologize for being selective.

If you've been looking for the people who are actually doing things — not just talking about doing things — you've been looking for us.
