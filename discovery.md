# Free State Party — Discovery Notes

## Client
- **Jeremy Kauffman** — owns freestate.party domain, leads the group
- **Dennis Pratt** — runs concierge/vetting service, anonymous on site

## What the Free State Party Is
A private club for liberty-minded free staters in New Hampshire. Not an org, not a nonprofit, not a political party (despite the name). In-person only, no Zoom. Selective admission through personal vetting — you come meet them, they decide if you're a fit.

## The Problem It Solves
Liberty-minded people who'd be a natural fit can't discover or evaluate the group without knowing Dennis personally. Growth is bottlenecked by one person's network. The site creates a warm, low-friction public touchpoint.

## Target Audience
- Free State Project movers (new and established)
- Liberty-minded NH residents who aren't connected to the existing org scene
- People who've gotten tired of stale committee meetings and official organizations
- The "I moved here for this but haven't found my people yet" crowd

## Aesthetic: Reactionary Futurism
Jeremy's term. Key characteristics:
- Past VALUES, not past practices — ambition, self-responsibility, greatness
- NOT trying to return to the land or be homesteaders
- Mid-19th century imperialism meets the space age
- Victorian ambition + manifest destiny + techno-optimism
- Forward into something better, powered by values that actually worked
- The site should feel like it was built by people who think big

## Relationship to Other Entities
- **Free State Project**: Separate. FSP is an official org. FSP is the movement; Free State Party is a private social club within it.
- **Free State Saturdays**: Sibling project. Open monthly gathering (Manchester). FSP is private/selective; FSS is open to everyone.
- **LPNH**: Separate. Allies. Some overlap in membership.

## Business Context
- Monthly fee opportunity for Bill
- Brand is expandable — liberty events statewide could come under the Free State Party umbrella
- MVP first, expandability built into the architecture

## Discovery Gaps
- No event photos yet
- No logo (styled text for V1)
- No specific upcoming event dates
- Vetting process details are intentionally vague — "introduce yourself and we'll reach out"
